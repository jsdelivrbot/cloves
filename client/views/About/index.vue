    <h1>About page</h1>
<p>This page is intended to provide a more detailed description of myself.  I have been programming and developing websites for 10 years.  My interest in computers and programming started as a trickle but has grown to become a waterfall of enthusiasm and curiousity.  In particular, it was web development and my observation of the internet which provided kindling for the fire of my interest.  Many new businesses would become realized and the effect of the internet upon the economy was a very material concern for both those who would embrace it and those who would ignore it.  Now that I have been making websites professionally and understand the code which it relies on, I am in a position to extrapolate the effects of this technology upon the economy and help businesses leverage it.</p>
<p>Web development has experienced particular growth characteristics in the field of computer science.  The rise of javascript, for example, is the web based programming language which has exploded in popularity and reach across multiple platforms.  There are many reasons for this but suffice to say it is my area of expertise professionally.  I specialize in writting javascript, in particular the future transpiled versions of javascript via babel, typescript, bucklescript among others.  Furthermore, I am familiar with the vast ecosystem of frameworks and libraries available in javascript and have taken particular interest in <a href=https://vuejs.org/ >Vue.js</a>.</p>
<p>As far as backend functionality, I am especially experienced with serverless architecture via <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/ >aws</a>.  These are the technologies I used for this site and my reasoning for this will be expanded upon in the <a href=https://nightshell.com/#/blog >blog</a>.  Finally, I wish to thank you for visiting and I look forward to providing thought-provoking content for your enjoyment!</p>
